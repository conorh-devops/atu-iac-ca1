## CF ASSIGNMENT
This is the repo for the Cloud Formation assignment to build a mini-network including EC2 instances for the various system components like backend, frontend, database and jumpbox. 

The network needs to be deployed and confifured to properly block and allow access from only the set entry points and includes a jumpbox for SSHing into the backend or database. 

This is all done with a template so that the deployment is easily repeatable if necessary
